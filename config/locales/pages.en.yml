          vorarlberg.speakerinnen.org is a project to prevent "manels",
          i.e. podiums, committees or panels that are predominantly occupied by men.
          Through the cooperation with <a href='https://speakerinnen.org', target='_blank'>speakerinnen.org</a>
          Vorarlberg women* become visible as experts, speakers and representatives of this region.
          They can be found both locally and internationally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project is made possible by the <a href='https://vorarlberg.at/frauen', target='_blank'>Funktionsbereich Frauen und Gleichstellung</a>
          im Amt der Vorarlberger Landesregierung and the <a href='https://www.vorarlberg-chancenreich.at/', target='_blank'>Marke Vorarlberg</a>.

          Podiums are frequently occupied largely by men. It is time for women to become
          active in order to change this. Via the platform ooe.speakerinnen.org, Upper
          Austrian women are made visible both locally and internationally as experts,
          speakers and ambassadors.
